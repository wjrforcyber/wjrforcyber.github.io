This talk is a presentation for MICS6001: Symbolic and Neurosymbolic Reasoning. You could fetch the related paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13155).
<br>Logical Neural Network(LNN) is developed by IBM, which is one of the core engine of their [Neurosymblic Tookit](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/toolkit/). This presentation gives a high level overview of what LNN is and what's happening under the hood. The key differences compared with classical Markov Neural Network. At the end, a quickstart live demo will help audience get familiar with how to use it in Python.
